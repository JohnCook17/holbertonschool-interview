# Radix sort

## Radix sort LSD
Radix sort is a great sorting algorithm for unsorted list. It works by takeing
the smallest digit and then sorting based on that, then it moves onto the next
digit and so on. This results in comparisons based on 0-9 at most in base 10.
This is one reason it is faster.
